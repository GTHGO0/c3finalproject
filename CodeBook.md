Feature Description
====================

**The following descriptions are provided as a previous background to interpret the "tidydataset.txt". Please refer to the next section to find a complete list of the patterns used in the codebook and dataset.**

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Pattern Description
====================

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'time': denotes the time captured at a constant rate of 50Hz
'body': denotes the signal recorded for the body 
'Jerk': denotes the signal recorded for a sudden movement
'Accelerometer': denotes a specific function based on acceleration of the phone
'Gyroscope': specific function based on the gyroscope of the phone
'Gravity': specific function based on the gravity of the phone
'frequency': the frequency domain signals
'magnitude': measure based on three-dimensional signals
'-XYZ': is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
'mean()': Mean value
'std()': Standard deviation


Data Set and Variable Description
====================
The data collected in the file "tidydata.txt" is the result of a series of steps and transformations of the raw data provided from:

>[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.

Notes: 
1. Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
2. Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
3. The data set is the result of a **GROUP BY** function.
4. The data was grouped by Subject and Activity.
5. Each column [3:68] represents the average of each observation in the dataset after being grouped by subject/activity.
